In this world people control the elements Water, Fire, Earth and Air. One person can only control one element except for the avatar after the avatar dies they reincranate the avatar is the master of all 4 elements, they bring balance to the world bettween the 4 nations Fire Nation, The Water Tribes, The Earth Kingdom and the Air Nomads. The 4 nations lived in harmony until the Fire nation attacked only the avatar could stop them but at the time he was needed most the avatar vanished if the avatar was dead he would have reincarnated but after 100 years there was no reincranate. People thought that the avatar cycle is broken.
